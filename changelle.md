## About the challenge

### Creation of API for registering and consulting products

You need to create an API with the following requirements:

#### End-point for data insertion

- The client can send them in json or xml files and the API
  you must insert it in the database.
- Choose the database you like best.

#### End-point for consulting these products

- Can be consulted by: id, name or tags. If the query is for a tag or name,
  should list all products with that search, it can be done at one or more end-points.

#### Mandatory Requirements

- Have relatively good test coverage, the highest you can get.
- Use PHP
- You can use any PHP framework for development or use none, it is your choice.
- Create a query cache.

#### PLUS - Not required

- Place a JWT authentication.
- Use PHP 7.1

## Guidelines

- Look for a succinct API.
- The files (json, xml) along with the format that the client will send are in the repository.
- Think about scalability, it can be a very large amount of data.
- Put this in a GIT repository.
- Put the setup guidelines in the README of your repository.

# Good luck
